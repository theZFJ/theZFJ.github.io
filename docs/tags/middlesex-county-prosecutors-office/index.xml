      <description>EDISON, N.J., Aug. 30 (ZFJ) — Edison middle school teacher Julius Coaccioli, 55, was arrested and charged with third-degree possession of child pornography on Wednesday, Aug. 30, announced Middlesex County Prosecutor Yolanda Ciccone and Woodbridge Police Department Director Robert Hubner.
Coaccioli has taught science at Woodrow Wilson Middle School since 2013, according to Edison Board of Education personnel resolutions.
Coaccioli was charged with possessing under 1,000 child sexual abuse images after the New Jersey State Police referred a cyber tip to Ciccone’s office.</description>
