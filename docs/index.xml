      <description>Editor-in-chief&amp;rsquo;s Note:
The article below is the original version of the article published 2022-01-07 in The Eagle&amp;rsquo;s Eye, archived by Alvin Wu, one of its writers. Published on a snow day, it received over 600 views before it disappeared less than 24 hours later in the Jan 2022 Censorship Incident. After the superintendent of Edison Township Public Schools saw it, it was ordered deleted and rewritten by the principal of Edison High School on the grounds that the article used a biased sample of quotes.</description>

      <description>The Zombie Fridge Journal is a student-run newspaper based in the New York City metropolitan area.
Its personnel are amateurs, so this journalism project could crash and burn at any time. They do what they do for fun.
Editor-in-chief Wu decided to make it after the Jan 2022 Censorship Incident, but it took him over a year and several holiday breaks to set up the website because he prefers napping to working.</description>
