      <description>Editor-in-chief Wu&amp;rsquo;s Note:
The article below is the original version of the article published 2022-01-07 in The Eagle&amp;rsquo;s Eye, archived by me, one of its writers. I proposed the article and received approval on New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve 2021 after the school district sent a community letter about the return to school during the largest surge in COVID-19 cases per day in the pandemic in the United States. I asked the Edison Board of Education questions at their public meeting on 2022-01-03 and interviewed various students for their opinions before winter break ended.</description>

      <description>The Zombie Fridge Journal is a student-run newspaper reporting on general affairs and based in the New York City metropolitan area.
Its personnel are amateurs, so this journalism project could crash and burn at any time. They do what they do for fun.
Editor-in-chief Wu decided to create it after the Jan 2022 Censorship Incident, but it took him over a year and several holiday breaks to set up the website because he greatly prefers napping to working.</description>
