      <description>May 28 (ZFJ) — The federal government can only regulate wetlands with “a continuous surface connection” to adjacent “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act (1972), ruled the Supreme Court on Thursday, May 25, in Sackett v. EPA (21-454).

      <description>The Zombie Fridge Journal is a student-run newspaper reporting on general affairs and based in the New York City metropolitan area.
Its personnel are amateurs, so this journalism project could crash and burn at any time. They do what they do for fun.
Editor-in-chief Wu decided to create it after the Jan 2022 Censorship Incident, but it took him over a year and several holiday breaks to set up the website because he greatly prefers napping to working.</description>
