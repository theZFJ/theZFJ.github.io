      <description>I don’t usually watch horror films (I get very scared), but the lunch table gang invited me to see the FNAF movie, so, of course, I made an exception this time. Also, I was intrigued after hearing mixed reviews from my classmates and decided I wanted to see it for myself.
I used to be terrified seeing the animatronics back in elementary school. That all went out the window after they released the Security Breach game a few years ago.</description>
