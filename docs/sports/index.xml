      <description>EDISON, N.J., Jan. 11 (ZFJ) — Senior Ghelsey Go has become the seventh girl and ninth player overall to score 1,000 points in basketball at Edison High School.&#xA;She scored 29 points in the varsity game against JFK on Saturday, Jan. 6, achieving the milestone after four years in high school basketball.&#xA;“I can’t even lie, when I scored the last points, my mind just went blank. I was like, what happens next, what’s going to happen next, and we still had a game to play, so I don’t think I really celebrated right away,” Go said.</description>
