"Someone has to do it." 

Wu is the cynical lunatic in charge of the ZFJ. He was a staff writer for the school newspaper, *The Eagle's Eye*, for two years, where he ran afoul of school administration with [an article about COVID-19.]({{< ref "/jan2022CensorshipIncident" >}}) He was then reassigned as sports editor from 2022 to 2023. He doesn't enjoy government affairs but still reports on them for some reason. He enjoys napping and playing video games. He hates having to do work and waking up before noon.
