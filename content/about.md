The Zombie Fridge Journal is a student-run newspaper reporting on general affairs and based in the New York City metropolitan area. 

Its personnel choose to run it for fun. It hasn't crashed and burned yet, so that's a good sign. 

Editor-in-chief Wu decided to create it after his [COVID-19 article was censored](https://www.zfjnews.com/jan2022censorshipincident/). It launched in May 2023. 

The ZFJ operates independently of any school authorities.

Any opinions expressed are of their respective writers and not the ZFJ.

## The Newspaper's Name

The ZFJ's name comes from a security joke. Some fridges these days can connect to the internet, and anything with an internet connection can theoretically be hacked (especially internet of things, or IoT, devices that don't receive frequent security updates). A device incorporated into a botnet by hackers is called a "zombie." Hence, zombie fridges. 

## The Newspaper's Motto

It's supposed to mean "always serious." But yeah, *of course it had to be in Latin.* Latin makes everything sound cooler. 

> The federal judiciary is staffed by total Latin dorks. 
> 
> — *The Onion, amicus brief for Supreme Court case* Novak v. Parma *(22-293)*

## The Parallel Universe Bureau

The ZFJ Parallel Universe Bureau is a major advancement for humanity based on the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation). Staffed round the clock by Nobel-winning physicists, PUB uses cutting-edge technology to receive reports from alternate universes and present to you. All of what they say is real—in an alternate universe bearing a bizarre resemblance to our own.

(If you haven't got it by now, it's the satire department.)
