The Zombie Fridge Journal is a student-run newspaper based in the New York City metropolitan area. 

Its personnel are amateurs, so this journalism project could crash and burn at any time. They do what they do for fun.

The ZFJ Parallel Universe Bureau is a major advancement for humanity based on the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation). Staffed round the clock by Nobel-winning physicists, PUB uses cutting-edge technology to receive reports from alternate universes and present to you. All of what they say is realâ€”in an alternate universe bearing a bizarre resemblance to our own.
