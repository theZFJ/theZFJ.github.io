*The Zombie Fridge Journal* is a student-run nonprofit and nonprofitable newspaper reporting on general affairs based in the New York City metropolitan area. 

Its personnel choose to run it for fun. It hasn't crashed and burned *yet*, so that's a good sign. 

Editor-in-chief Wu decided to create it after his [COVID-19 article was censored](https://www.zfjnews.com/jan2022censorshipincident/). [Its first article](https://www.zfjnews.com/science-and-technology/2023/66-chance-world-exceeds-warming-threshold-before-2027/) was published on May 18, 2023. 

The *ZFJ* operates independently of any school authorities and is neither affiliated with nor endorsed by any of them.

Any opinions expressed are of their respective writers and not the *ZFJ*.

## Our Name

The *ZFJ*'s name comes from a security joke. Some fridges these days can connect to the internet, and anything with an internet connection can theoretically be hacked (especially internet of things, or IoT, devices that don't receive frequent security updates). A device incorporated into a botnet by hackers is called a "zombie." Hence, zombie fridges. 

## Our Motto

It's supposed to mean "always serious." But yeah, *of course it had to be in Latin.* Latin makes everything sound cooler. 

> The federal judiciary is staffed by total Latin dorks. 
> 
> — *The Onion, amicus brief for Supreme Court case* Novak v. Parma *(22-293)*

This publication's name is pretty silly, but we don't treat journalism as any laughing matter. We're not professionals, but we're committed to our work. We'll review court documents, scientific reports, and a whole lot more to get the facts straight. You can find sources listed at the end of each article. 

## The Parallel Universe Bureau

The *ZFJ* Parallel Universe Bureau is a major advancement for humanity based on the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation). Staffed round the clock by Nobel-winning physicists, PUB uses cutting-edge technology to receive reports from alternate universes and present to you. All of what they say is real—in an alternate universe bearing a bizarre resemblance to our own.

(If you haven't got it by now, it's the satire department.)
