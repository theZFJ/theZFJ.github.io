The Zombie Fridge Journal is a student-run newspaper reporting on general affairs and based in the New York City metropolitan area. 

Its personnel are amateurs, so this journalism project could crash and burn at any time. They do what they do for fun.

Editor-in-chief Wu decided to create it after the [Jan 2022 Censorship Incident]({{< ref "/jan2022CensorshipIncident" >}}), but it took him over a year and several holiday breaks to set up the website because he greatly prefers napping to working.

The ZFJ operates independently of any school authorities.

## The Newspaper's Name

The ZFJ's name comes from a security joke. Some fridges these days can connect to the internet, and anything with an internet connection can theoretically be hacked (especially internet of things, or IoT, devices that don't receive frequent security updates). A device incorporated into a botnet by hackers is called a "zombie." Hence, zombie fridges. 

Yea, Wu knows he's horrible at thinking of names. He's working on it. 

## The Parallel Universe Bureau

The ZFJ Parallel Universe Bureau is a major advancement for humanity based on the [many-worlds interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation). Staffed round the clock by Nobel-winning physicists, PUB uses cutting-edge technology to receive reports from alternate universes and present to you. All of what they say is realâ€”in an alternate universe bearing a bizarre resemblance to our own.
